# Browser and API tests

## Install

Install the Fitnesse-standlone products (just a jar file), then from the directory the jar file is in:
```
java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8001
```
The default port is "80" but as that is commonly used, you can add option to specify your own port choice.


## Run Test

Open Fitnesse URL, which from above example will be http://localhost:8001

You will see the test, and you can run within the browser, by clicking "Test"


A word of warning on the @coinbase service (and probably others): when using 2-factor auth as part of logging in. If your mobile phone is lost/stolen (along with auth app setup, of course), there begins one of the most anti-user login support processes I have ever experienced.
