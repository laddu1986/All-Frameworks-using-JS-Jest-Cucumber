#selenium-cucumber-ruby-kickstarter

##Background

A quick example of how to bring Selenium, Cucumber and Ruby together to automate a Google Search.

### Getting Started
      1. Ensure you have the firefox or chrome browser installed - install chromedriver if using chrome
      2. Ensure you have ruby installed (built and run with 2.5.0) - use rvm
      3. Ensure you have rubygems and the bundler installed
      4. Navigate to the cloned project in your terminal
      5. Run 'bundle install'
      6. Run 'bundle exec cucumber'

Please note that this will run the feature in the chrome browser as default. To run this test in firefox just pass the argument
`-p firefox`  e.g. `bundle exec cucumber -p firefox`
